## Project Instructions
In this project, students will apply their skills in building layouts and navigation files by building a Shoe Store app.
This project will consist of five screens. You don't have to create a shoe store, you can use any other item as long as you create the following screens. You will be creating:

1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons
2. Welcome onboarding screen
  1. Instructions onboarding screen
4. Shoe Listing screen
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe

While the login and onboarding pages will not do anything, the user will need to save the login state so that the login and onboarding pages do not show again.

The shoe listing page will show the list of shoes and show a button for adding a new shoe, while the detail page will be for adding a shoe entry. All entries will be saved only as long as the app is running.
